#summary Depot for frequently used scripts.

The need is pretty obvious. It is usefull to have a location where all the favourite scripts are stored, that can be centrally rynchronized and used by varius bash and SQL scripts.

I call this one 'scripto' and place it always in HOME directory. It is called 'scripto' to diferenciate it from 'scripts' name which is sometimes found.

{{{
$ cd
$ svn checkout https://oracleinfrastructure.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/scripto scripto 
$ cd 
}}}

Following projects use extensively from this depot, but I also use it for frequently used SQL scripts.

Together with variable SQLPATH I can run the SQL scripts in SQL*Plus.
{{{
$ vi .bash_profile
SQLPATH=$HOME/scripto/oracle/sqlbin
export SQLPATH

NLS_DATE_FORMAT='YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'
export NLS_DATE_FORMAT

SQL> @tbs
Show size of tablespaces
