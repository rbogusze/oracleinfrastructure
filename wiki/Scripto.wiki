#summary Depot for frequently used scripts.

The need is pretty obvious. It is usefull to have a location where all the favourite scripts are stored, that can be centrally rynchronized and used by varius bash and SQL scripts.

I call this one 'scripto' and place it always in HOME directory. It is called 'scripto' to diferenciate it from 'scripts' name which is sometimes found.
