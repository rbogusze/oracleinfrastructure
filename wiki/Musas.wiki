#summary Store performance reports for future reference

I find it beneficial to have an offsite location of AWR / Statspack reports together with SQL reports that allows me easily to see what was happening on the database yesterday, week ago, month ago, etc.

Please note that using AWR reports requires a valid extra licence for Diagnostic Pack. Actually very similar report can be collected using a free old-style Statspack.

This project simply collects the AWR reports once a day together with SQL report and stores them on logwatch host.
