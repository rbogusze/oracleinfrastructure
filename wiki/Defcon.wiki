#summary Visualising the AWR / Statspack report

<img src="http://oracleinfrastructure.googlecode.com/files/defcon.png" width='648' height='506' />

This project as a prerequisite needs the [Musas] project running - to provide the raw AWR / Statspack reports. As we have those reports it is relatively easy to do some draws.

This project was born from the need to somehow show developers a nice picture that will tell them more than the raw numbers.
