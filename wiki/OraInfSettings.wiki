#summary Environment settings, some assumptions

Host used to monitoring: logwatch, user: orainf
Host with Oracle DB beeing monitored: dbhost, user: oracle, SID: TEST

All the provided examples use !CentOs 4.7 minimall install.

For the LDAP uniqe numbering I applied to IANA for Private Enterprise Number and received one. It is 35297.

Some standard packages used
{{{
# yum install vim-common vim-enhanced gawk screen subversion xorg-x11-tools
}}}

Make sure that the hosts can see each other. Test on both logwatch and dbhost
{{{
# ping logwatch
# ping dbhost
}}}
